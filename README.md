# holographyReductionPython
At the SMA (and later at GLT) we have been using the codes developed by TK (1997-2010, roughly), on near-field holography mapping. See SMA technical memo number 169: Holography Analysis Software - HOLISv2, for details. (HOLIS was originally created by Xialoei Zhang sometime in 1994-1997).
These fortran (and a few C) codes have been hard to maintain, and not well documented. 
All these codes are now translated to python here, and the workflow is simplified. A pipeline script in bash has the sequence of codes to run on an input holography map. Currently these new codes are being used only at GLT.
